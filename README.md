# Description
IronSpace is a game in which the Ironhack spaceship tries to shot and destroy the different programming languages that appear in the space.

# Main Functionalities
- If the Ironship shot the obstacle, add 5 points.
- If the Ironship donÂ´t shot the obstacle and the obstacle reaches the goal, lose 10 points.
- If the score is less than 0 points, the game ends.
- If the obstacle collides with the Ironship, no points are deducted, but the game ends.
- Every x points scored, the speed of each obstacle increases.
- The left and right keys are used to move the Ironship, and the space bar is used to shot.



# Backlog Functionalities
- Add an obstacle that if the Ironship shot it, a second ship will appear which will help the main ship destroy the programming languages.
